Rule:
· Pontoon - one card has a rank of ace and the other card is a picture card, i.e. has rank of J, Q or K.

· Five card Trick - there are five cards with a total value of 21 or less. Ace has value of one and picture cards have value of 10. The total value of the cards doesn’t matter as long as it is 21 or less.

· Highest total of 21 or less. Ace can have a value of one or eleven. e.g. two kings and an ace would have a value of 21 but an ace and a 3 would have a value of 14.

· Hands totalling more than 21 are “bust” and worth nothing

The player must have a higher scoring hand than the dealer to win, otherwise the dealer wins.
